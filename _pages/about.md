I'm a Ph.D. student in Experimental Psychology at UC San Diego in the [Visual Learning Lab](https://visuallearninglab.ucsd.edu/), advised by [Bria Long](https://brialong.github.io/). I received my B.S. in Cognitive Science at UC San Diego, where I specialized in Machine Learning & Neural Computation and minored in Computer Science.

My research focuses on **egocentric vision**, **visual representation learning**, and **perception and interaction in naturalistic environments**. I study how infants learn from what they see in daily life—using large-scale egocentric video (e.g., the [BabyView](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.10447) dataset), computer vision (object detection, CLIP, DINO), and behavioral experiments to quantify naturalistic visual experience and its link to early concept development. I'm interested in making developmental psychology more data-driven and ecologically valid, and in using multimodal and AI tools to study human learning at scale.

## beyond research

Outside of research, I enjoy CrossFit, gardening, cooking, and forays and tidepooling. I also have a bunny named Mochi, a five-year-old rescue from Austin.
