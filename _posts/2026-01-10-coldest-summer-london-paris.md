## Paris, on a Whim

I was in Europe for a conference and took a few days off to see Paris. The idea had been planted months earlier by *The Paris Novel*, a book whose food descriptions were so vivid I could practically taste them through the pages. Unlike the book's protagonist Stella, though, I didn't plan out any fine dining experiences. Most of the time I just wandered and looked up whatever nearby restaurant had good reviews.

My favorite dish of the whole trip was a Burgundy-style salad with jambon persillé, which is basically a pork and parsley terrine with garlic, served cold. The vinaigrette had this bright acidity that made the whole thing feel refreshing and satisfying at the same time. It also made me finally understand why people pair wine with rich food. The natural acidity and aroma probably cuts through heaviness in the same way the vinaigrette did. Too bad I'm allergic to alcohol.

Some days I played the role of Local Parisian, or at least my idea of one. I'd grab my "panda grocery bag" (a big tote my mom gave me that I bring literally everywhere), pick up a fresh baguette from the bakery, get some cheese and French butter weighed out at the fromagerie, grab some salami or ham, and head to a park to read and eat. I even got roped into a chess game with some locals. Other times I'd buy a crêpe and sit by the river, watching the boats go by, the pedestrians crossing the bridge, the diners at the restaurants on the opposite bank. Everyone seemed like the opening scene of their own story. What I didn't expect was that eating outdoors in Paris makes you a target for wasps. They eye your food the way seagulls do, except wasps have zero concept of personal space.

Over those few days I visited some classic landmarks and two museums, wandered through neighborhoods where centuries-old architecture sits right next to modern life, and flipped through ancient books at a community library. Paris is incredibly walkable and clearly designed with pedestrians in mind, which I loved.

Oh, and a little saga. My Airbnb toilet clogged on night one. By 7:30 the next morning I was going door to door through every convenience store and mini-market in walking distance, asking for a plunger. Shop after shop: *"Euh… outside, outside…"* I finally found one at Monoprix, thanks to Reddit.

At the register, I couldn't help myself. I needed this cashier to understand what I'd just been through. So I'm slowly explaining in English that my toilet clogged the moment I arrived, that I've been to six stores already, waving the plunger around with one hand, slapping my forehead with the other. She didn't get it at first, but then it clicked. She shook her head and went *"Oh la la!"*, did this whole motion of pulling her hair out, and wished me good luck.

Then I walked back through the 16th arrondissement holding a bright red plunger aloft with a bag full of drain supplies, marching in the opposite direction of everyone quietly commuting to work. I must have looked like I was heading to storm the Bastille.

## Crossing the Channel

I'm writing this on the Eurostar, somewhere under the Dover Strait. In Paris I'd been surviving on broken French, aggressive hand gestures, and facial expressions doing about 80% of the heavy lifting. I wonder what London will be like.

## London in Three Days

I landed in London and was immediately jumped by wind and "low temperatures." Technically just the low teens Celsius, not actually cold, but without sun and with that wind, it felt like winter. For a second I thought I was back in a San Francisco summer. I wonder if Mark Twain would ever say: *The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in London.* I panic-bought a jacket that afternoon and went straight to my Airbnb to make American chicken noodle soup, my personal cold-prevention ritual. The Airbnb had a cat named Dasheng (大圣, after the Monkey King), and honestly he was one of the best parts of the whole trip.

My first feeling stepping into London was pure relief. I could speak English again.

Right off the train platform I ran into someone improvising on a public piano, completely in their own world. Every Tube station had a different busker. A band here, a singer-songwriter there. I later found out London has a whole *Grassroots Music Tube Map* that documents the underground music scene station by station.

I saw *Les Misérables* in the West End. Sat in the back of the stalls, didn't matter. I cried multiple times. Having just been in Paris seeing the actual historical paintings in the museums made the whole thing hit differently.

In Soho, I walked past the National Portrait Gallery during some kind of community sketching event, so I sat down and drew for a while with the materials they had out. Also in Soho, I made the mistake of peering curiously into the Nothing store and making eye contact with the staff. They waved me in and spent almost half an hour showing me every product they had. They knew I was an American tourist who wasn't going to buy anything there, and they still gave me company merch and told me to just order online when I got home so I'd have a U.S. warranty. No pressure, just genuinely nice.

Three days is nothing, obviously. But I kept running into these small moments, this casual, baked-in respect for art and music and people, that made me want to come back for much longer.

## The Food, London Edition (Yes, Really)

I came to London a little worried about the food situation. The reputation precedes it. But actually? Everything I tried was good.

I had Beef Wellington at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I will admit I was quietly hoping it would come out underdone so I could say *"It's RAW!"* But no, it was annoyingly perfect. English breakfast, fish and chips, all solid, all comforting in that way where you didn't realize you needed it until it was in front of you.

I also reunited with an old friend I hadn't seen in years (we were so excited we forgot to take a single photo, which I think says something). We did Brazilian barbecue together. Absolutely massive, and yeah, a bit more flavor than the British stuff, I won't lie. Oh, and I discovered at the supermarket that Lay's are called Walkers here. Same company, different name. The kind of thing you only learn by wandering grocery aisles in another country.

Two fast weeks in Europe, now back in San Diego. Already thinking about where to go next.
